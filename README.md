# missionaries-cannibals-problem.
This project is a generalised solution of the classic missionaries and cannibals problem. The problem involves transporting missionaries and cannibals across a river in a boat without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by cannibals.A state-based approach to find all the possible situations using the A* search algorithm.
